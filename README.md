This was an annaversary project for my girlfriend on our one year. Using a raspberry pi zero and a 2.9 inch E-paper display. The device output a meassage to a 2.9 inch E-Paper display updating multiple times a day with the ability to override the scheduled message displays. The stored text file can be added to and overriden for a 12 hour period.

## Email   
I started learning about how to pull emails from the Gmail client.
Using an article by [Humberto Rochas,](https://humberto.io/blog/sending-and-receiving-emails-with-python/) on sending and recieving emails with python gave me a great start for getting emails from gmail to the display. 

In order to get past Googles security I had to push past the security. To do that I navigated to Google Account settings > Security > scroll down near the bottom to Less Secure App Access and turn that on. This got me past the [AUTHENTICATIONFAILED] Invalid credentials (Failure) that Rochas example was giving me. 

As for using the IMAP python function I found this article very helpful with IMAP formatting.

## Case

This was one of the areas that I was more comfortable in at the beginning of this project. I used OnShape a free CAD software with tons of video tutorials online. 

Most of the project involved measurments. Most of my time was spent using calipers and measuring things multiple times, however these schematics for the [rapsberry pi zero](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LHeqV.png), and the [e-Paper display]() from the manufactur website were very helpful.
